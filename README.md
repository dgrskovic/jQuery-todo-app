# jQuery-todo-app
Another to-do app :)<br>
This is my little project written in HTML/CSS/jQuery.<br>
Toggle input field by clicking on plus/minus icon.<br>
Add a task by pressing Enter, mark it completed by clicking on it, and delete it by clicking on the trash icon.<br>
You can check it out <a href="https://dgrskovic.github.io/jQuery-todo-app">here</a>.
